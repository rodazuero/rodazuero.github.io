	 R package that uses the  
	<a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/intro?hl=en
">Google Maps Distance Matrix API</a>
	 to compute the distance and time between two points. In order to be able to use the function you will need an
	 <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/get-api-key#key
">API key</a> 
	  and enable the Distance Matrix API in the Google Developers Console. Google maps should be able to find both, the origin and the destination in order for the function to run. If the origin or destination contains multiple words, they should be separated by a plus sign (+). The distance is returned in meters and the time in seconds.
Four different modes of transportation are allowed: "bicycling", "walking", "driving", "transit".   </p>

            <p>A preliminary version of gmapsdistance in Python is available in  <a href="https://github.com/rodazuero/gmapsdistancePY">this link</a>. The function performs multiple queries simultaneously. The output is a matrix of time and distance between points.</li></p>

            <p><a href="https://github.com/jtilly">Jan Tilly</a> has made some modifications that have significantly improved the quality of the package. </p>

	<p>
	The use of graphics processing units (GPU) rather than CPU, is a powerful tool to increase the speed of your code. There have been some applications of it to Economics, in particular to perform Value Function Iteration (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165188910002216">Check Link Here</a>). However, I am not aware of any available code that uses such techniques for estimation strategies more suited for microeconomics. I have developed a basic code performing Maximum Likelihood estimation of a standard mincer equation. The code is available  <a href="https://github.com/PennEcon/gpu-examples/tree/master/c%2B%2B/mle_mincer">here</a>.
