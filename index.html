<p><a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>I am currently an Economist at Amazon working in the Customer Behavior Analytics team. I work at the intersection of causal inference and machine learning and I'm passionate about new developments in these fields. Prior to Amazon, I worked at the <a href="http://www.iadb.org/en/inter-american-development-bank,2837.html">Inter-American Development Bank</a> (on leave between September 2019 until May, 2020), and a Visiting Assistant Professor at the Department of Quantitative Theory and Methods at Emory University. I obtained a PhD in Economics from the <a href="http://www.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a> in May, 2017. My research fields are applied microeconomics, labor economics, development economics, and applied econometrics. </p>
